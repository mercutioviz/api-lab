This repo has some simple scripts and docs to assist with getting started using API interfaces with various Barracuda products.
## Barracuda API Information

## Reference Information
The following are some references that I personally found helpful for various aspects of doing APIs and scripting
* Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`

* Install PowerShell 7 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7
- Note: PS7 installs side-by-side with PS5.1 in Windows 10
