# api-lab
This repo has some simple scripts and docs to assist with getting started using API interfaces with various Barracuda products. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to give the user an easy path to getting started with using APIs on selected Barracuda products. It is not meant to be comprehensive, rather it is more of an "API 101" introduction. 

## Barracuda API Information
* WAF
Bash and PowerShell scripts
PS API module

* WAF as a Service

* CloudGen Firewall

* Cloud Security Guardian

## Reference Information
The following are some references that I personally found helpful for various aspects of doing APIs and scripting
* Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
(restart computer)

* Install PowerShell 7 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7
- Note: PS7 installs side-by-side with PS5.1 in Windows 10

* PowerShell Master Class series on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nFq_hR7FcMYg32xsSAObuq8
